# StaxReactCodeSamples

This is a repo of React components I, Joanna Wheeler, constructed for a virtual hangar organization application, a private repo. 

The Tab component accepts data and passes it down to its subcomponents to render a unique menu on each tab of the application. 

The Aircraft tab within this repo is an example of one of many tabs in which unique menus would display.

I followed TDD practices in creating the components. I was provided tests written in Enzyme to and made them pass as I created each component.

I received permission from the repository owner to post these code samples on my Github for public viewing.
